Welcome to the our first version of the website created to support Team 250.

This is our first experience with web development. As a result, we began by learning basics of HTML and CSS and applying them to create this version of a new Team 250 website. 
We implemented a total of 5 pages including Home, About, Competitions, Alumni, and Links. We experimented with various CSS styling and is still actively learning new styles.
We began stepping our foot into Javascript and installed the necessary environment to convert this website to be applicable in React. The beginning of this new version of the Team 250 website is in WEBSITE2.0
We are also learning how the React library works as well as more quality of life tools such as Tailwind CSS.
