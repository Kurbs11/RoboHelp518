    <div class="summary">
        <p>Our team is comprised of 66 male and female students from the Capital Region of New York State. Students come from two primary schools, Colonie Central High School in Colonie a suburb of Albany and Shenendehowa High School located about 15 miles north of Albany. One team member is a home schooled student and another attends a private military institution, Christian Brothers Academy. Fifteen of the members participated in 2001. The class ranking distribution is Freshmen - 25%, Sophomores - 16%, Juniors - 40% and Seniors - 19%.</p>
        <p>Team 250 has won numerous awards since it began participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition in 1992. In 2001, with the help of our Alliance Partner Teams 353, 263, 190 and 533, we won the Long Island Regional Championship and in 2000 our Team was a Silver Medalist at the same event.</p>
        <p>Our 2002 season began in October with seminars related to systems likely to be used in this year's robot. These weekly seminars are continuing through December at the same time as we work on designing and building machines to enter in an intra-team competition. The challenge is to build something to move across a 10-meter track in 60 seconds, no more, no less. Photocells at the start and finish lines will document our success or failure. Minimal restrictions are imposed, so what we design and build is limited only by our imaginations. Sound Familiar ???? We'll post some photos from the competition in December.</p>
        <p>Although sponsored by GE Power Systems and Verizon Communications, our team relies heavily on community volunteers for engineering expertise and mentors. Engineering students and faculty from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) are mentoring the team and students from Hudson Valley Community College will be assisting with machining tasks.</p>
