# RoboHelp518

To address the lack of helpful computer science resources in many of the region’s high schools, we are here to lend a helping hand. 
Some of these high schools have robotics teams, but not many programmers to transform their robot from a static masterpiece into a mobile champion.
We currently have connections with FRC Team 250 in Colonie NY and Team 5149 in Troy. 
The aim of this project is not only to help contribute to scripts for this year’s competition, but to start developing resources to make it easier for team members 

The aim for this semester is to help Team 250 by contributing to their computer vision resources. Depending on if Team 5149 builds a robot this year, after the computer vision project is done, we intend to program their robot so it can compete in the tech valley regional competition.

What we have accomplished so far:

We were able to develop Team 250's vision system alongside another mentor through OpenCV's python library. Our system consisted of a camera to observe the April Tags and a Raspberry Pi to run the scripts to determine our distance and angular offset from each tag and starting game piece. As of now, it has not been implemented with the rest of the robots controls programming, but has been proven to work as an independed component.

After previous goal, we have set out to create a modern website for Team 250 so the team can get further outreach to bring in new students and even mentors. This is currently being done using the standard HTML, CSS, JS tech stack, but there are plans to redevelop it using fancier frameworks once we are content with the original version. We currently have an introductory segment describing the team, pictures during this robots development, pictures and other data pertaining to this years competitions, and will be looking to add an alumni page on to show where past members of the team have ended up. We hope this can incentivize students to join the team, and maybe even show potential mentors the quality of a student they would have the opportunity to work with. 

We will be presenting our results later in April, but will continue to develop the website thereafter.
