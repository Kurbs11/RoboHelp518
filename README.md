# RoboHelp518
Placeholder name (hopefully)

To address the lack of helpful computer science resources in many of the region’s high schools, we are here to lend a helping hand. 
Some of these high schools have robotics teams, but not many programmers to transform their robot from a static masterpiece into a mobile champion.
We currently have connections with FRC Team 250 in Colonie NY and Team 5149 in Troy. 
The aim of this project is not only to help contribute to scripts for this year’s competition, but to start developing resources to make it easier for team members 

The aim for this semester is to help Team 250 by contributing to their computer vision resources. Depending on if Team 5149 builds a robot this year, after the computer vision project is done, we intend to program their robot so it can compete in the tech valley regional competition.

Milestone goals:
By 2/17/24: Complete progress on the computer vision system with team 250

After previous goal, by 3/8/24: Program operational control systems (such as driving) for team 5149 robot

3/15/24: Complete any remaining subsystems such as programming a potential shooting mechanism so the students have time to practice driving and operating before the 3/20 competition.

After previous goal, pending team interest: by 4/20/24: Create modern website for team 250 (and maybe even 5149) so the teams can get further outreach to bring in new students and even mentors
